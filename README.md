# JournalSlurp
Retrieving Evernote entries and adding them to DayOne, the long way

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sequethin/JournalSlurp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sequethin/JournalSlurp)

The goal of this project, aside from trying out some stuff in Java, is to allow me to write journal entries in
Evernote while I'm on the go and have them auto-imported into my DayOne journal. This is because I love DayOne,
but there's no DayOne for Android.

This is something I could have achieved in a few lines of Python, but I needed some practice with Java.
There are no doubt lots of mistakes and bad ideas going on in here, but give me a break, it's my first
Java project!

Busy working on other stuff - planning to pick this up again (soon... ish)
